    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the soup by combining the chicken bones, some ginger slices, garlic cloves, 
            and green onion (sliced in 3 inch pieces) in a large pot of boiling water. Boil 
            for at least 3 hours and extract the soup into a bowl and place it in the fridge. Wait until it solidifies.</li>
        <li>Get a cleaver and mince the pork shoulder until it is similar to a ground pork consistency.</li>
        <li>Make ginger water and mince some more garlic.</li>
        <li>Combine the minced pork shoulder with ginger water, garlic, white pepper, salt, msg, and soy sauce to taste. 
            Cube the solidified broth and add it into the dumpling filling mixture.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, make a dough of pliable consistency and knead until soft.</li>
        <li>Take a small piece of dough and roll it out into a circle</li>
        <li>Add a small but sizeable amount of filling and pleat it towards the center in a soup dumpling shape</li>
        <li>Repeat until you run out of filling or dough.</li>
        <li>Place dumplings into steamer and eyeball their doneness</li>
        <li>Check doneness by opening and tasting one.</li>
        <li>When done, serve with vinegar on the side.</li>
    </ol>
